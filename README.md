## Aggregation Pipeline

MongoDB's **Aggregation Pipeline** is used in this project to perform complex queries efficiently. It is particularly useful for gathering and manipulating data across collections.

### Finding Subscribers of a Particular Channel

The aggregation pipeline is used to query and find the number of subscribers of a particular channel. This is achieved by joining the users' subscription data with the channel information using the `$lookup` operator. The pipeline aggregates the data by counting the number of subscribers for the channel.

### Finding the Number of Channels a User is Subscribed To

We also use the aggregation pipeline to determine how many channels a user has subscribed to. This is done by querying the user's subscription data and performing a count operation to return the total number of channels the user is subscribed to.

### Example Aggregation Pipeline:

```js
// Finding subscribers for a particular channel
db.subscriptions.aggregate([
  { 
    $match: { channelId: "specific_channel_id" } 
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "users", 
      localField: "userId", 
      foreignField: "_id", 
      as: "subscribers"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: { 
      subscribersCount: { $size: "$subscribers" } 
    }
  }
]);

// Finding the number of channels a user is subscribed to
db.subscriptions.aggregate([
  { 
    $match: { userId: "specific_user_id" } 
  },
  {
    $count: "subscribedChannels"
  }
]);
